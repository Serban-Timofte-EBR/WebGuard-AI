# WebGuard AI

## Project Overview
**WebGuard AI** is a cloud-based solution that evaluates the security of websites based on their URLs. It leverages AI models and cloud services to analyze various security aspects, including SSL/TLS configurations, potential vulnerabilities, phishing indicators, and malware presence. The tool provides a comprehensive security score and a detailed report, helping users understand the security risks associated with a website.

## Key Features
1. **SSL/TLS Validation**: Checks for valid SSL certificates, weak ciphers, and proper configurations.
2. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Uses AI models trained on known vulnerabilities to detect issues like SQL injection, XSS, etc.
3. **Phishing and Malware Detection**: Applies machine learning models to identify characteristics of phishing sites or malware distribution.
4. **Content Analysis**: Evaluates the website's content for suspicious scripts, hidden iframes, and unusual redirects.
5. **Security Score and Report**: Generates a detailed security report with a score based on the analysis results.

## Technology Stack
- **Azure Machine Learning**: To build, train, and deploy AI models for phishing, malware detection, and vulnerability scanning.
- **Azure Cognitive Services**: For NLP-based content analysis to detect phishing and malicious content.
- **Azure Functions**: For serverless execution of security checks such as SSL/TLS analysis and scanning.
- **Azure Blob Storage**: To store logs, analysis results, and historical data.
- **Azure Key Vault**: For securely storing API keys, certificates, and credentials.
- **Azure Logic Apps**: For orchestrating workflows and integrating various services.
- **Optional**: **Azure Sentinel** for integration with a SIEM system for monitoring and alerting.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Set Up Cloud Environment**: Configure Azure services like Azure Machine Learning, Functions, and Blob Storage.
2. **Data Collection and Preparation**: Gather datasets of phishing, malware, and benign websites and preprocess the data for model training.
3. **Develop AI Models**: Train machine learning models for phishing detection, malware detection, and vulnerability analysis.
4. **Create Security Check Modules**: Implement modules for SSL/TLS checks, vulnerability scanning, and content analysis using Azure Functions.
5. **Integrate and Deploy**: Integrate all components and deploy them to Azure.
6. **User Interface or API Development**: Develop a web interface or API endpoint for users to input URLs and receive security reports.
7. **Testing and Refinement**: Test the solution with diverse websites and refine models and logic.
8. **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Set up monitoring using Azure Monitor or Application Insights for performance tracking.

## Expected Outcomes
- A fully functional AI-powered tool that can assess website security based on URLs.
- Hands-on experience with cloud services, AI, and cybersecurity concepts.
- A valuable addition to a portfolio showcasing cloud-based AI solutions in cybersecurity.

## Future Enhancements
- Adding more sophisticated AI models for advanced threat detection.
- Real-time monitoring and alerting capabilities using Azure Sentinel.
- Support for integration with third-party security tools and APIs.
